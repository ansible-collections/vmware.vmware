bugfixes:
  - Updated common VM deployment module docs to mention that name or MOID can be used for the resource pool, cluster, datastore, and datastore cluster parameters.
    This allows users to work around issues where the name is not unique. Fixes https://github.com/ansible-collections/vmware.vmware/issues/239
